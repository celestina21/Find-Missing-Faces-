                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <h2>By harnessing the power of image recognition technology, we aim to reunite families and communities.</h2>
                <p>Through this innovative technology, user-contributed photos are analysed for faces potentially matching those of reported missing persons, aiding in search efforts and providing hope and support. We are dedicated to creating a platform where every uploaded image has the potential to make a meaningful difference, bridging gaps and bringing closure to those in need. Together, we can empower our community to play an active role in solving cases and making a positive impact in the lives of others.</p>
